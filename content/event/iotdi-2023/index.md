summary: "This talk discusses how to analyze vulnerabilities in an attack graph using attack traces and ways to harden them."
abstract: "In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been extensively deployed in edge networks, including smart homes and offices. Despite the exciting opportunities afforded by the advancements in the IoT, it also introduces new attack vectors and vulnerabilities in the system. Existing studies have shown that the attack graph is an effective model for performing system-level analysis of IoT security. This presentation goes over system vulnerability analysis and network hardening. We first extend the concept of attack graph to weighted attack graph and design a novel algorithm for computing a shortest attack trace in a weighted attack graph. We then formulate the network hardening problem."
