summary: "This talk discusses how IoT networks can be analyzed in weighted attack graphs and how an effective hardening plan can be devised using attack graphs and attack traces."
abstract: "Nowadays IoT devices are ubiquitous, bringing convenience in our lives. However, security and privacy issues due to vulnerabilities in the devices remain a major concern. This talk presents a systematic way of analyzing vulnerabilities in an IoT network using attack graph, and how an effective defense strategy can be found using limited budgets."
