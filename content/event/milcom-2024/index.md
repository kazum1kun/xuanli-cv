summary: "This talk discusses the definition of the most vulnerable attack trace in probabilistic graphs and methods to find them."
abstract: "In this talk, we investigate the properties and computation of attack traces on probabilistic attack graphs, a model that integrates probability into traditional attack graphs to reflect the varying exploitability of network vulnerabilities. We introduce the Most Vulnerable Attack Trace (MVAT) problem, which aims to identify the attack trace with the highest cumulative success probability for an attacker."
